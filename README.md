# AES_Algorithm

> This is an implementation of the 128-bit ecb AES Encryption

## usage

### encryption

```
./aes128ecb encrypt [[-k|--key] <hex-string> | [[-p|--plain] <value as plain string> | [-b|--bytes] <value as hex-string>]]

```

### decryption

```
./aes128ecb decrypt [[-k|--key] <hex-string> | [-b|--bytes] <value as hex-string> | [-h|--out-hex] output as hex string, default: plain string]

```
